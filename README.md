# VoxelChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.8.

## Versions
- npm: 8
- node: 16
- angular: 14.2

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Important
I didn't put a lot of work into the UI, this is intentional because it is outside of the scope of the challenge.

The use of ngx-pagination and ng-bootstrap is not intended to be evaluated as both are only used to show ideas such as pagination and the rating component. Using those 2 libraries allows me to reduce the development time and focus on more important parts of the challenge.

## A non exhaustive todo list of things that are outside of the scope of the challenge
- Server side pagination
- Implement full ShowBackend model
- Improve UI
- Implement client side caching
- Implement loading skeletons
- There are comments that highlight specific parts of code that can be improved but were left as is due to the scope of the challenge and the time assigned for it.
- Add documentation
